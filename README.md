Introduction
------------

ProDataLab, a software engineering organization that because of years of experience, represents a philosiphy that software is much more complicated and fragile then it ought to be. From the user's perspective or the or from the developer's perspective.. the goal is to create a paradigm shift in software engineering that makes the software and it's development, extremely flexible, intuitive, compartmentalized, scalable, distributable, and universal across all devices. The moto ProDataLab lives by is, "Everything is a component.. Everything!"

This proposal is to create an open source system that allows components to simply plugin and become fully integrated
with any of the other components regardless of the language it was written in. Essentially it is a system
that will have user interfaces on every hardware or software platform to interact with it. Separation of
all concerns.. their maximal integration.. and extreme efficiency is the soul of the ecosystem described in this paper.

The components themselves will be interfaces to, or services of, any imaginable discipline or use case.
From the casual user to the most professional, the ecosystem will have components that accomodate and
integrate. Interfaces will be universal on every available hardware platform. Integration with existing
systems will also be a focus. The use case and integration potential is nearly limitless.

ProDataLab believes that automation and software translation is not utilized nearly enough, which is why
ProDataLab has a strong endearment to and knowledge of the foundational pillars of computer science and
theory of computation itself. Soon the ecosystem will demonstrate that all code, even existing code, can
be connected and re-purposed. The thought that entrepeneurs and venture capitalists invest millions of 
dollars to get new software based innovaton off the ground is amusing.

Efficiency, as the soul of the ecosystem, is a very important term in that it describes not only a great
emphasis on computational and developmental efficiency, but also user experience efficency. Software 
should be as intuitive as it possibly can be. Users should have all the control they desire in its
usage and flexiblity.

Described below are the components of this proposed ecosystem. Each component should be considered in 
conjunction with all of the others, as it is the ecosystem in its whole that provides the greatest 
value proposition.

Please also note that this an early, mostly abstract version of this proposition and will become
a fully disclosed specification for both implementation and a governence model at version 1.0. This
proposal is itself an opensource project in that the community this proposition is intended for, 
is most encouraged to participate in its structure and therefore this document.


Note:
    Why shouldn't the open source community have decentralized control over the majority 
    of all software.

CodeChain
---------

Essentially, CodeChain is distributed decentralized operating system that provides significant 
advancements over top of all conventional systems. 

* Architecturally inspired by [Flow Based Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming), a computational system created by
  J. Paul Morrison at IBM in the early 1970's.[1]
* Will reduce software development time-to-market by a possible factor of a hundredfold.
* Utilizes components of software that are virtual black boxes. Only concerns are the connection of inputs and outputs, but only for components that have not already been submitted to the system.
* Atomic components are comprised of snippets of code that only do one thing and do it well.
* Atomic components are combined to form composite components
* Components are connected dynamically at runtime, or statically.. as needed
    * Connections of components can be assembled or dissassembled in realtime
* Once a component is created, it never has to be written or connected again.. forever! Yes, forever in the literal sense!
    * Distributed Database
* The creation of new software will never need to concern itself with what has been created
  before, it just merely connects to it.
* Virtually eliminates text-based source code concerns and language silos
    * No more conventional APIs
    * No more cross language barriers.
    * Relegates all conventional programing paradigms as moot.
* User Interface 
    * UI for all apps are universal and available on all possible devices.
    * A UI compiler will be available for one-stop UI design to deployment on all hardware/software devices/platforms.        (See CodeSweet)
    * Application data are securely synced for all devices/platforms.
    * Extremely intuitive with easy access to well thought out help documentation.
    * Builtin WorkSource integration to customize the app or add your own features.
    * UI designs are built upon CodeChain components too, meaning that the experience 
      is extremely flexible and customizable to each users preferences.


CodeDepot
---------

* A decentralized market place for developers and end users
* An interface for developers to deposit code submissions that will be used by CodeChain.
* Developers are paid per snippet of code otherwise known as components as described in CodeChain.
* Developers are paid for any contribution made to 
* An interface to a store for end users to install apps from.


CodeDepot Foundation
--------------------

* A decentralized governence model for this ecosystem. For the open source community .. by the open source community. 
* See https://github.com/DavidJohnstonCEO/DecentralizedApplications


WorkSource
----------

* A decentralized market place for end users to hire developers
* Is directly accessible from the end user's interface to CodeDepot
* Is directly accessible from all application interfaces for seemless customization availibility.


CodeSweet
---------

* A suite of developer tools designed to simplify the developer experience and, in conjunction with CodeChain, reduce a software project's time-to-market by a hundredfold.


CodeCoin
--------

* The ecosystem's crypto-currency token for monetizing goods and services.
