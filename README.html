<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id47">Overview</a></h1>
<blockquote>
Utilizing state-of-the-art crypto-currency technologies and an unconventional
programming model, a complete paradigm shift in technology production is possible.
Time-to-market for all software developers could decrease by a hundredfold. It is
strongly believed that the innovations presented below, will change the way all
computing is done in the future. ProDataLab would like to emphasize, that this truly
amazing efficiency would not be possible without the ability to stand on the shoulders
of giants.. the open source software community! ~Peter Alexander, ProDataLab</blockquote>
<p>Bob Dylan once wrote a song titled &quot;Everything is Broken&quot;. We take that notion and consider
it quite apropos for the conventions in today's software usage, sales, production and
execution. A participant can find inefficiencies and un-warranted complexities practically
everywhere in today's environment. We ask the reader to take a moment and
think of their own experiences with software. Have you ever found yourself frustrated?
Have you ever considered some aspect overly complicated, un-intuitive or in-flexible and
thought to yourself &quot;it shouldn't have to be this way&quot;?</p>
<p>An end-user of software might have thought of how hard it is to get familiar with a
software product or that the documentation and help system are simply not much help.
They might have wished for a feature they needed to be available or that the there were
too many features packed into the product. Small business owners may find navigating the
obstacle course of software system selection and integration impossible for mere mortals.
Software engineers may have thought of many areas of foolishness that surround their
profession. The lists of areas ripe for innovation surrounding the software ecosystem
are quite abundant.</p>
<p>Other aspects of concern and inefficiency can be seen in the marketplace itself. Golieth
sized companies hold monopolistic power over software marketplace silos. These concentrated
marketplaces take large percentage
commissions from a lowly software producer's product sales. They dictate rules that are
at times overly stringent or simply used to control the domination they hold in the market.</p>
<p>The readers of this paper are asked to consider very thoughtfully what they themselves,
specifically, would have improved, because it is that specific item or list of items that
will be fixed by what is proposed in this paper and its addendums.</p>
<p>This paper is currently in its first draft and is itself an open source project for inspired
persons to contribute their ideas to. Eventually it will reach a 1.0 status at which point it
will have the appearance more of a specification than of merely a white paper. At this point
I encourage you to envision the possibilities of a collaborative effort to change the current
paradigm surrounding the production, consumption and usage of software. You are encouraged to
join this effort to modernize the entire software ecosystem via open source software and its
principles. Please become a contributing member of the CodeDepot Community.</p>
<!-- note:: Say: Bring _your_ innovations and implement them. -->

<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id48">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Software is ubiquitous in our lives whether we are users or producers. Yet, even a less than
astute observer can see that the entire ecosystem is ripe for innovation. In this paper we will
begin a conversation of the direction of the needed improvements and we ask the community
to participate. This community that is mentioned, are the people that engage with software
whether it be in its production, sales, tutelage or usage.. whether they are casual or power users.
Having discussion and contribution globally and easily, will ensure that the best solutions of
problems we all identify, will be addressed most thoroughly and efficiently.</p>
<p>Below are six foundational pillars of a proposed software ecosystem
that may forever change the entire paradigm of our engagement with software. What is presented
at this time are merely proposals that will be refined by any
willing individual participant and all the participants in whole. The paper also will
introduce other worthy aspects and notations pertinent to the execution of this proposal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-codedepot-foundation">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id49">The CodeDepot Foundation</a></h1>
<p>Together, an engaged society will undoubtedly find the best solutions to issues that face them. Over
the past 40 years, the open source community has shown that open participation most often
provides better results than that of a closed system. We present here a decentralized organization
where every member of the community has the opportunity provide direction through proposals,
discussion and ultimately to that of solutions. We suggest that Decentralized Autonomous
Organizations <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id26" id="id1">[1]</a>,
a new concept now available through cutting edge technology, will provide many benifits over
conventional and centralized organizational structures where they are applicable.</p>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id50">Overview</a></h2>
<p>The CodeDepot Foundation is the working name of a proposed open governance model for the
CodeDepot ecosystem; where directives and decisions are decentralized and democratized
amongst the entire community <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id27" id="id3">[2]</a>. This notion of decentralized governance is aimed at stemming
the problems of any centralized governing system that naturally creates hierarchical levels of control.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin's underlying technology of the blockchain <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id28" id="id4">[3]</a>, brings a radical departure from the
governance model of the old world. It follows trends of decentralization that have emerged
through the internet in recent years including Bittorrent, Free Software and Open Source
Movements and collaborative production platforms like Linux and Wikipedia. The essence of this
game-changing invention is distributed trust (no need for third party reconciliation). Bitcoin
solves the scaling issue of trust. With its decentralized security, we can now create a more open and
inclusive society at a global scale.</p>
<blockquote>
Bitcoin's decentralized system opens a door to a new paradigm where people can choose to abide by a protocol of consensus which is a different from the logic of domination and control of a centralized paradigm. Technology can't solve everything. Technology is just a tool. It always needs to be accounted for by democratic consensus of people. Technology should never be used to replace human interaction and connection.. it should be used only to enhance it. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id29" id="id5">[4]</a></blockquote>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id52">CodeCoin, The currency of the ecosystem</a></h1>
<p>The invention of blockchain technology in 2008, has provided for the world a whole paradigm
shift in financial and contractual mechanisms. It is truly a marvel that will disrupt many
incumbent institutions. Systems that once required intermediaries and centralized
solutions can now be peer to peer and decentralized. Trust of persons and entities unknown
can know be established without the need of 3rd parties for verification or validation.
Moneys can now be sent digitally without any concern for fraud or corruption. Ability to make
payments in fractions of a penny are now facilitated. These are truly amazing times and we
as a community of software engagers can benefit from this remarkability.</p>
<div class="section" id="id8">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id53">Overview</a></h2>
<p>CodeCoin is the proposed crytpocurrency <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id32" id="id9">[7]</a> that will be used in this software ecosystem. It is
essentially a token that will be used to monetize all the goods and services within the ecosystem. This
cryptocurrency will be at the center of a well considered autonomous economic model of incentives and
disincentives formulated by the community. As with other aspects of this proposal, an emphasis
for thought leaders to be engaged in these models is vehemently sought after and strongly encouraged.

<p>The core component of the ecosystem is a marketplace where users and producers engage.
This is composed of two parts where developers will deposit code into the system
and users will have an interface to utilize it. Other participants will include documention
contributers, article writers, bloggers, audio and video producers. Actually, anything surrounding
software and related technology.</p>
<p>As described in the section for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ProDataLab/CodeDepot#codechain-the-decentralized-processing-engine">CodeChain</a> below, developers will be rights holders for what essentially
are snippets of code called components in this paper's nomenclature. They will use
CodeDepot as a repository and market interface for their components of code and
other contributions.</p>
<p>Users will have many advantages  over conventional software produced today including but not limited to:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Flexibility</li>

<li>Security</li>
<li>Ease of use</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>

<p>The problems with the conventional programming paradigm are numerous. In fact, at the time
of the initial draft of this paper, querying Google's search engine for &quot;The problems with
programming languages&quot; produced nearly 72 million results. It seems fruitless
to itemize these problems as a comparison to what is proposed here, let alone the problems of
the entire software-centric paradigm. Instead, as an introduction, we ask the following
questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>What if snippets of software were in essence Lego like reusable components that just snapped together into a desired structure?</li>
<li>What if once a component or a structure of components was created, it would never have to be created again by anyone? Yes, ever again as in the literal sense of forever.</li>
<li>What if once a component was created it would be shared by every piece of running software in the world that required it?</li>
<li>What if an executing software system, even a mission critical system, could be altered or replaced without even a nanosecond of down-time.</li>
<li>What if it did not matter which programming language was used to create an individual component and that any component could seemlessly communicate with others?</li>
<li>What if a software producer's time-to-market was reduced by a hundredfold?</li>
<li>What if a software's execuation was most reliable and the most possibly secure from intrusion?</li>
<li>What if a software user's privacy was held in the highest regard.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>CodeChain, it will be shown, is a system that could and will provide these desirable properties, as well
as others.</p>
<div class="section" id="id11">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id63">Overview</a></h2>
<p>CodeChain is a decentralized system <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id33" id="id12">[8]</a> which at its core reflects
the philosphy of component based software engineering (CBSE) <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id34" id="id13">[9]</a>. It is entirely inspired by
J.Paul Morrison's <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id35" id="id14">[10]</a> Flow-Based Programming (FBP) <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id36" id="id15">[11]</a>. The concepts of FBP are
improved with secure decentralized computing, communication and database models from
various sources including BitCoin <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id37" id="id16">[12]</a>, BitTorrent <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id38" id="id17">[13]</a>. CBSE exhibits the very desirable property
of loose coupling <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id39" id="id18">[14]</a>. FBP, a particular form of dataflow programming <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id40" id="id19">[15]</a> extends loose
coupling to define bounded buffers, information packets with defined lifetimes, named ports,
and most importantly a separate (lazy) definition of communication connections <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id41" id="id20">[16]</a>.</p>

<p><em>The following is taken from J.Paul Morrison's Website.</em> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id42" id="id21">[17]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flow-Based Programming is a programming paradigm that uses a &quot;data factory&quot; metaphor
for designing and building software applications. Applications are defined as networks
of &quot;black box&quot; processes, which exchange data across predefined connections by message
passing, where the connections are specified external to the processes. These black
box processes can be reconnected endlessly to form different applications without having
to be changed internally. FBP is thus naturally component orientated.</p>
<p>It views an application not as a single, sequential process, which starts at a point
in time, and then does one thing at a time until it is finished, but as a network
of asynchronous processes communicating by means of streams of structured data chunks,
called &quot;information packets&quot; (IPs). In this view, the focus is on the application
data and the transformations applied to it to produce the desired outputs.
The network is defined externally to the processes, as a list of connections
which is interpreted by a piece of software, usually called the &quot;scheduler&quot;.</p>
<p>The processes communicate by means of fixed-capacity connections. A connection is
attached to a process by means of a port, which has a name agreed upon between
the process code and the network definition. More than one process can execute
the same piece of code. At any point in time, a given IP can only be &quot;owned&quot; by
a single process, or be in transit between two processes. Ports may either be
simple, or array-type. It is the combination of ports with asynchronous processes that
allows many long-running primitive functions of data processing, such as Sort,
Merge, Summarize, Collate, etc., to be supported in the form of software black boxes.</p>
<p>Because FBP processes can continue executing as long they have data to work on and
somewhere to put their output, FBP applications generally run in less elapsed time
than conventional programs, and make optimal use of all the processors on a machine,
with no special programming required to achieve this.</p>
<p>The network definition is usually diagrammatic (see: 'Component Based Programming' below), and is
converted into a connection list in some lower-level language or notation. FBP
is thus a visual programming language at this level. More complex network definitions
have a hierarchical structure, being built up from subnets with &quot;sticky&quot; connections .</p>
<p>FBP has much in common with the Linda language in that it is, in Gelernter and
Carriero's terminology, a &quot;coordination language&quot;: it is essentially
language-independent. Indeed, given a scheduler written in a sufficiently low-level
language, components written in different languages can be linked together in a single
network. FBP thus lends itself to the concept of domain-specific languages or
&quot;mini-languages&quot;.</p>
<p>FBP exhibits &quot;data coupling&quot;, described in the article on coupling[*] as the loosest type
of coupling between components. The concept of loose coupling is in turn related to that
of service-oriented architectures, and FBP fits a number of the criteria for such an
architecture, albeit at a more fine-grained level than most examples of this architecture.</p>
<p>FBP promotes high-level, functional style of specifications that simplify reasoning
about system behavior. An example of this is the distributed data flow model for
constructively specifying and analyzing the semantics of distributed multi-party protocols.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id65">Limitations of FBP</a></h2>
<p>At a superficial level, FBP is an ideal programming paradigm that offers quite a few
benefits over conventional paradigms. At scale though, there is a limiting condition of
context switching, especially so on conventional general purpose CPUs <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id43" id="id22">[18]</a>. For an FBP paradigm at scale,
a point will be reached where the
number of
context switches on a single machine CPU, overwhelms the system and causes notable latency.
On average, context switching costs approximately 30 microseconds of
overhead per occurrence. One benchmark of the theoretical limitations of context switching has an upper
bound of 18.75% of CPU cycles wasted due to context switching. Generally, optimal CPU
use, is to have the same number of worker threads as there are hardware threads when a process is CPU bound,
whereas I/O bound permit more <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id44" id="id23">[19]</a>.
These considerations puts the FBP paradigm at very much a disadvantaged ideal of maximal
efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="component-based-programming">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id66">Component Based Programming</a></h2>
<p>In order to overcome the conditional limitations of context switching per processing node, in a
strictly FBP paradigm, we provide here an area of consideration to help maximize the efficacy of the CodeChain
system. The term Component-based Programming (CBP) is coined here for the purpose of a enlisting a stronger
emphasis on components over that of data flow as it is for FBP.</p>
<p>The concepts fundamental to FBP (autonomous black-box components loosely coupled via lazy linkage)
can be easily
considered at the various phases of the compilation stack prior to execution. Essentially what this means,
is that we can remove the constraints, from that of each component, needing to be its own execution process
or thread, yet
still be most loosely coupled. We can redefine networked inter-process components to that of a
virtual model, that can then be implemented, by encompassing one or all of the compilation's
translation stages prior to execution.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Source code</li>
<li>Semantic analysis</li>
<li>Intermediate Representation (IR) code and its linkage</li>
<li>Machine code and its linkage</li>
<li>Just-In-Time compilation or interpreter engine</li>
</ol>
<p>Another most exciting and promising consideration, is to apply the notion of CBP to include that of speciality hardware
processors like that of GPGPUs <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id45" id="id24">[20]</a>. GPGPUs provide a processing model of thousands
concurrently executing threads. Utilizing these high-scale concurrent processors, one can imagine the
promise of the original FBP concept of inter-communicating processes/threads without the extreme burdens
imposed when merely targeting that of a CPU architecture.</p>

<!-- * Google Helpouts

<p>WorkSource is a proposal for a open governence, decentralized, peer to peer marketplace for end-users
to hire freelancers.
It will employ modern cutting edge technology for monetization, accounting, reputation,
contractual obligation and
in the case needed, arbitration. The most prominent aim is to incorporate very simple access and functionality directly
into the CodeDepot user-interfaces. Unlike current freelance market places, freelancers will be made to
feel as equals and not
of a second class, as compared to employers.</p>
<p>Non-technical users of software often find themselves in need of instruction or in need of customization. By
incorporating direct and easy contact with software professionals, the users needs can be addressed
painlessly, immediately and reliably.</p>
<p>Technical users find themselves paying exorbitant fees to hire developers at conventional centralized
services. Often the employer will find these services confusing, frustrating and simply inadequate.</p>
<p>Freelancers will often find that scanning and applying for jobs, is simply too time consuming.</p>
<!-- develop the idea of a market chain (all) and its sidechains (e.g: codedepot). -->
<div class="section" id="id25">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id74">Overview</a></h2>
<p>Current freelance and other work-sourcing like exchanges, are usually run by a
centralized corporate entity that enjoy a significant percentage of the
cost of the transaction; together with collecting monthly fees. In a decentralized;
self-governed; peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace there isn't any centralized entity,
just a community of colleagues and clients. Freelancers enjoy the near entirety
of the proceeds of their transactions without some third party dipping their
greedy hands in.</p>
<p>New technologies, most significantly bitcoin's blockchain, have now enabled P2P
marketplaces to thrive unencumbered by any need of a centralized entity or 3rd party.
The need for trust is virtually eliminated.. providing free, flat, P2P markets.</p>
<p>WorkSource will be decentralized, community effort, that will provide reliable sources of
service providers to those that need such services. Current cryptocurrency, and other
new technology, make it possible to enable most efficient market ecosystems where trust
and incentive/disincentive mechanisms are automated; built right in to the platform. This,
together with ideas generated and implemented by the community, will make the platform
most desirable and efficient to participate in.</p>
<!--     Introduction
    `````````````
WorkSource will be a superset community of sectoral communities for instance that of
the software sector, namely CodeDepot [#]_. -->

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id75">CodeSweet</a></h1>
<p>A programmers toolbox is most often burdensome and time-consuming to be productive with. It could be
argued that every tool in use by engineers is in some way problematic or simply incomplete. If every
aspect of every tool and its interface were a component, then the programmer could fashion their tool
and hence their toolbox to be just the way they liked it. That bears repeating.. If everything is a
component, then the programmer could fashion their tool and hence their toolbox to be just the way
they like it!</p>
<p>CodeSweet will be a component based toolkit where engineers have the ability to add features that they
deem worthy.. leaving any others behind. Features like automation, intuitive instruction, reimagined
user interfaces, and ease-of-use will be of strong focus.</p>
<!-- ToDo:: Emphasize the CodeChain Toolbox and how the goal is to make software production unbelievably seemless ! -->
<p>Other aspects will include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The best documentation tools and interfaces</li>
<li>Employing intelligence and automation as much as possible</li>
<li>Search and reference to be topped by no other</li>
<li>Intuition</li>
<li>Cutting edge compilation and translation chains</li>
